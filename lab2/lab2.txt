
Goal

The primary purpose of this lab is to become comfortable with transformations.
Shapes

Download the trans.c program and get it to work. It draws a coordinate axes in yellow, and three shapes: two discs and an ellipsoid. The key routine, drawDisc, draws a disc centered at the origin. The program uses the glTranslated() function to move where the origin appears, and uses the glScaled() function to alter the aspect ratio before drawing a circle. You can use scaling to make objects bigger, and use the floating point version glScalef() version to make them smaller.
Task 1

Make the red disk a fat ellipsoid. What happens to the position of the green shape? Why?
Version 2

The version we were playing appended translations: two steps forward, one step back. Download the trans2.c and run it. I have tried to create the same shape as I did in the first version, but don't quite have it. Fix it.
Task 3

Using the new starting point, make the red disk a fat ellipsoid. What happens now?
Version 3

Now we introduct rotations. Download the trans3.c and run it. I have introduce a rotation of the green shape. What has changed?

Consider the code below. I have suggested four places to put the call to glRotated(): where we put it, and three other places. Try each, and explain what you see.

setColorGreen();
glLoadIdentity(); /* Return to origin */
// Try here
glTranslated(5,2,0);
// Try here
glScaled(1,4,0);
glRotated(45, 0, 0, 1);
drawDisc();
// Try here
glFlush();
