Run the program LightPosition. You will find the source the the program on our website, but there are datafiles and library files that are needed as well.

Light Material Experiment with Nate Robins' LightMaterial program. You will find the source to the program on our website, but there are datafiles and library files that are needed as well.

Light Torus Take a look at Sam Buss' Light Torus example. LightTorus.c and LightTorus.h.
